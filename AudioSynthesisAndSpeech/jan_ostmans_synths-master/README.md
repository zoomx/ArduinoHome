## A Few Simple Synths from Jan Ostman

Each of these four directories can be moved into your Arduino sketch directory, compiled, and flashed.  They're all serial-port adaptations of some synthesizer cores that Jan Ostman wrote, and they make fantastic jumping-off points for your own experimentation.

I wrote an [article on Hackaday](http://wp.me/pk3lN-NMh) to go with them.  Go there for samples and instructions.  Or just flash the code and hook up to the Arduino with a good serial terminal at 9600 baud.

In the long run, it'd be neat to modify and modularize these to make an easier-to-modify AVR-based synthesis library.  If you're interested in such a project, fork away and get in touch.
